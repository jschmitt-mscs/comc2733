Create a web page with 3 unordered line items

When you roll over / mouse over each item, an event is triggered

Handle the event by updating some other element in your html

Create 2 variables and 1 constant:
    a text string
    a number (less than 10)
    another number that is a constant (less than 10)

When hovering over the first <li>, update your target element with the text variable

When mousing over the second <li> update your target element with the first number variable

When mousing over the third <li> update the page with the sum of the two number variables (by having Javascript add them together)

Declare and initialize the variables in an external file

Use "inline" Javascript in your <li> elements.

Use Javascript in your script.js file to update your target element when the page initially loads

Zip and submit
